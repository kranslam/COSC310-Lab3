# COSC310 Project:

#Mapping for a Change

This software gives a comprehensive view of all shelters in Kelowna for people in need of housing. The list can be accessed by employees of a shelter to help direct their clients to appropriate services based on parameters like age, gender etc. Additionally, the software addresses the need for companies / shelters to keep track of what resources are currently available and has the ability to update the data in real time should availability change. With these features we aim to give the shelter employees an easy, straightforward tool to use and streamline the process for people seeking help.

This repository contains a documentation folder with all the appropriate documentation as well as diagrams to describe our software.

Additionally we have the performance review spreadsheet and the code folder which will contain the prototype front-end and back-end.
